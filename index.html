    <p>Dogs are domesticated mammals that belong to the Canidae family. They are known as man's best friend due to their
        loyalty, companionship, and their ability to form strong emotional bonds with humans. Here are some key points
        about dogs:

        1. Breeds: Dogs come in various breeds with different physical traits, temperaments, and sizes. Some popular
        breeds include Labrador Retrievers, German Shepherds, Golden Retrievers, Bulldogs, Poodles, and Beagles.

        2. Lifespan: The average lifespan of a dog ranges from 10 to 13 years, although smaller breeds tend to live
        longer than larger ones.

        3. Sizes: Dogs can range in size from small breeds like Chihuahuas and Maltese to medium-sized dogs like Border
        Collies and Cocker Spaniels, and large breeds such as Great Danes and Saint Bernards.

        4. Senses: Dogs have a well-developed sense of smell, which is an estimated 10,000 times more sensitive than
        humans. Their hearing is also superior to ours, and they can detect sounds at a wider range of frequencies.

        5. Communication: Dogs communicate through body language, vocalizations, and behaviors such as wagging their
        tails, barking, growling</p>
